#### Model and Event

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

A model object encapsulates data that pertains to a particular application. For example, we have model objects which will represent tasks and events in the context of a to-do manager. In PriorityQ, a `TaskList` has many `Entries` which can be either a `Task` or `Event`. In addition, PriorityQ also keeps a list of Tags that are used to tag entries. These objects temporarily keep track of data which will ultimately be persisted through the `Storage` class. PriorityQ makes use of a text file in .xml format to persist user data. This data will then be loaded into the application when PriorityQ is first launched. Conversely, when any changes are made to the model object, the xml file will be updated to reflect these changes.


Since PriorityQ follows an MVC framework, user actions in the view layer are propagated to the model via the `Logic` component, which acts as a controller object. When a user creates a new task in PriorityQ, a `Task` model object is created. In PriorityQ, event-based programming is made use of via the `EventsCenter`. For example, model changes which might involve updating of other objects will be transmitted by informing the EventsCenter of a new event.

Certain GUI interactions are propagated to the logic component using the `EventsCenter`:

The `list` command supports filtering entries by multiple conditions (e.g. title, tags, due date). `PredicateBuilder` is a class in `Model` that chains these predicates to allow the combination of multiple search conditions. It follows the _Singleton Pattern_: `PredicateBuilder` has a private constructor, a static instance and a public `getInstance` method to access this only instance.

#### Storage

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The storage component encapsulate the need of handling data read and write by any other component. The storage component also provide a facade that covers several storage such as the user preference storage and the task manager storage itself. By doing so, other component just need to interact with the facade storage and not the user preference storage or the task manager storage directly which may add complexity. The storage class itself is flexible as we can change our type of storage, such as Xml to Json easily without changing the whole component.


#### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

#### Program workflow

This section gives an overview of PriorityQâ€™s program flow. PriorityQ uses the Model View Controller paradigm. It is a simple, yet reliable and commonly used method for structuring applications. It also suits the design need of our system. The flow of the program would look like this:

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file
(default: `config.json`):

## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
> If you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later), enable assertions in JUnit tests
  as described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option).

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
   These are in the `guitests` package.

2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.priorityq.commons.UrlUtilTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.priorityq.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.priorityq.logic.LogicManagerTest`

**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode.
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.

## Features

#### Adding a new task or event
```
add <task_name> [start/<start> end/<end>] [#<tag_name> ...] [repeat/<recurrence>] [desc/<description>]
```
PriorityQ supports three types of entries. They are task, floating task and event.

To add a task, specify an end date which represents the deadline.

Examples:


- `add CS2105 Assignment 1 end/2016-10-10 10:00`

To add a floating task, add without specifying a the start or end date.

Examples:


- `add watch The Matrix`


Last but not least, to add an event, specify both the start and end time.

Examples:


- `add CS2103T Lecture start/2016-10-10 10:00 end/2016-10-10 12:00 repeat/weekly #rocks`


```

#### Editing an entry
```
edit <entry_id> [title/new title] [start/<start> end/<end>] [#<tags>...] [r/ <recurrence>] [desc/<description>]
```

 It is also possible to modify an existing entry by specifying it's id. Almost all aspects of an entry can be edited. You can choose to change the title, dates, description and tags. Note that tag(s) specified in the edit command would replace the existing tag(s) of the entry. If you only want to add a single tag to the existing list of tags, use the tag command instead.

Examples:

- `edit 3 title/Animatrix`

- `edit 3 #movie #must watch`

 You may also choose to chain the edits into a single command like this:

- `edit 3 title/Animatrix #movie #must watch`


```

#### option
```
option [<type>/<value> ...]
```
If there is a need, you can also change where PriorityQ stores your data. 

Examples:

- `config save/data/MyNewLocation.xml`

```
