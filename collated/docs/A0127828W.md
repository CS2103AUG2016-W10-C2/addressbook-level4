## Introduction

Welcome to PriorityQ’s developer guide! PriorityQ is a task manager for the modern power user who enjoys working primarily with the keyboard.

This guide aims to help you get familiarised with PriorityQ’s design so that you can extend or contribute to it. We also provide specifications on the development environment and testing.

## Setting up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given
   in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.

## Design

### Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>

The architecture diagram given above explains the high-level design of PriorityQ. Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/priorityq/MainApp.java).

* At app launch: It is responsible for initialising the components in the correct sequence, as well as linking them up.
* At app exit: It is responsible for shutting down each component and invoking any clean-up methods.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of PriorityQ consists four components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) :  Displays GUI(Graphical User Interface) to user.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Represents actual data in the program.
* [**`EventsCenter`**]() : Handles callbacks for event that’s happening from the model changing.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Our architecture follows the _MVC Pattern_: UI displays data and interacts with the user; Logic listens to events from UI, and acts as the bridge between UI and Model; Model & Storage stores and maintain the data.

### Components

#### Logic

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component acts as an intermediary between the view and any model/storage objects. `Logic` objects are thus a channel through which view components learn about changes in model objects and vice versa. Logic objects also handle the coordination of tasks in the system.


In PriorityQ, a logic object interprets user actions made in view objects, such as entering a command, and communicates these information to the model layer. When model objects change, a controller object relays these changes to the view objects so that they can display it to the users.


All valid user input are parsed into `Command` objects. Each command has a separate class (e.g. `AddCommand`, `ListCommand`, …), and all of them implement the `Command` interface. The interface acts as an abstraction layer so that Logic does not need to know the implementation details of each `Command` class, and makes sure that every command class follows the same architecture. The individual details of each command (command keywords, valid format, …) are defined in each `Command` class.


The parsing of user commands is done by `Parser`. `Parser` is invoked every time a command is entered. It first confirms that the given command is of the correct format. The command string is then passed to the individual parser of each command to return the appropriate Command object.


After that, the `Command` objects are executed by `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` implements the `Logic` interface, which also acts as an abstraction layer to other components of PriorityQ. `LogicManager` will call the execute method to execute the `Commands` objects. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the UI. This follows the _Command Pattern_: `LogicManager` executes commands without having to know the specific command type.


`Command` execution can affect the `Model` and `Storage` (e.g. adding an entry) and/or raise events.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

`ArgumentTokenizer` is a utility class which is used by Parser when parsing the user input. It allows more flexibility by tokenizing command parameters, so that no specific order has to be pre-defined.

```

#### Searching for Entry
```
list [[keywords] [[after/<date>] [before/<date>] | [on/<date>]] [#<tag_name> ...] [type/{entry, task}]
```

List all entries, or entries that satisfy the given search criteria. You may search for entries by title, date, tags or even entries For the best user experience, completed entries and past events are _automatically excluded_.

Examples:

- `list`

- `list title/buy`

- `list after/2016-10-10`

- `list on/today`

- `list #groceries #shopping`

If you want to include completed entries in your search, replace `list` with `list-all`

- `list-all buy banana`

By default, completed tasks will be hidden to let you concentrate more on what needs to be done next. You can still include completed entries in the search by using list-all command.
```
list
>>> [1] Buy blankets for doge
list-all
>>> [1] Train for marathon
>>> [2] Buy blankets for doge
>>> [3] buy apple #shopping
>>> [4] Buy bananas for scales
```

## Advanced Features
We also provide some additional advanced features to help you with navigating the app.

#### Undoing and redoing a command
Task that is deleted erroneously can be recovered using the undo and redo command. You can undo up to the last 20 commands.
```
list
>>> [1] Buy groceries
delete 1
>>> Buy groceries deleted.
undo
>>> Undo delete Buy groceries
list
>>> [1] Buy groceries
```

## Command Summary
Here is format for the command summary:
- Parameters enclosed in square brackets are optional. e.g: [#\<tag_name>]
- Parameters enclosed in angle brackets are required. e.g: \<task_name>
- Parameters with trailing … means multiple value separated by commas can be inserted. e.g: #school #university #CS2101

| Command |Format |
| --- | --- |
|add|`add <task_name> [start/<start> end/<end>] [#<tag_name> ...]  [repeat/<recurrence>] [desc/<description>]`|
|list|`list [[keywords] [[after/<date>] [before/<date>] | [on/<date>]] [#<tag_name> ...]] [type/{event|task}]`|
|tag|`tag <entry_id> #<tag_name> [#<tag_name> ...]`|
|untag|`untag <entry_id> #<tag_name> [#<tag_name> ...]`|
