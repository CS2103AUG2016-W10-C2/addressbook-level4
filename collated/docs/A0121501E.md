## Appendix E : Product Survey

### Trello:

Strengths:

- Geared towards task management: focus on only 1 thing
- Covers various aspects of task management: deadline, assignees, descriptions, discussions
- Designed to be collaborative
- Unique UI, which gives a great overview of the tasks
- Cross-platform

Weaknesses:

- Missing ability to schedule recurring tasks
- Poor integration with calendar
- A bit cluttered for personal use, since it’s designed for collaborative work

### Evernote:

Strengths:

- All-in-one swiss army knife: Not only task management, can keep notes as well
- Good in capturing tasks that need to be done before a specific date/time, or after a specific date/time, and items without specific times.
- Can access tasks online and offline (if Jim is willing to pay for Evernote premium)

Weaknesses:

- Needs a few clicks/keyboard shortcuts to add a new task
- No way to “block” some time out except by explicitly writing it in a note.

### Google Keep:

Strengths:

- Compact UI that allows for many tasks to be viewed at once.
- Colored tasks as visual aid.
- Checkbox to indicate task completion. Alternatively, tasks can be archived to indicate completion.
- Supports dynamic content such as links, images and drawings.
- Sync through multiple gadget.

Weakness:

- No options for viewing the list of tasks in different orders (most recent, deadline etc)
- No calendar view.

#### Tagging an entry
```
tag <entry_id> #<tag_name> [#<tag_name>...]
```

Add tag(s) to a particular entry. To add tags to an entry, specify the entry you want to tag by it's entry_id, which is displayed on the left of all entries.

Examples:

- `tag 12 #CS2103T #rocks`

Delete tag(s) from a particular entry with the specified id using `untag`

- `untag 12 #rocks`

Duplicated tags will only be added once

#### Deleting an entry
```
delete <entry_id>
```
Eventually, you might find that you no longer need a particular task. Sometimes, tasks might also be added by mistake. You can delete such tasks via the delete command, along with the id of the task.

The task will then be removed from PriorityQ and will no longer exist.

Example:

- `Delete 4`


#### Marking a task as complete
```
mark <entry_id>
```

Tasks can be marked to indicate they are completed and would be hidden from the `list` view. Note that events cannot be marked and they will be automatically hidden when they are over. 

Check (or uncheck, for `unmark`) a entry as completed.


Examples:

- `mark 42`

- `unmark 42`

```
