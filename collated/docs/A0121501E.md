## Appendix E : Product Survey

### Trello:

Strengths:

- Geared towards task management: focus on only 1 thing
- Covers various aspects of task management: deadline, assignees, descriptions, discussions
- Designed to be collaborative
- Unique UI, which gives a great overview of the tasks
- Cross-platform

Weaknesses:

- Missing ability to schedule recurring tasks
- Poor integration with calendar
- A bit cluttered for personal use, since it’s designed for collaborative work

### Evernote:

Strengths:

- All-in-one swiss army knife: Not only task management, can keep notes as well
- Good in capturing tasks that need to be done before a specific date/time, or after a specific date/time, and items without specific times.
- Can access tasks online and offline (if Jim is willing to pay for Evernote premium)

Weaknesses:

- Needs a few clicks/keyboard shortcuts to add a new task
- No way to “block” some time out except by explicitly writing it in a note.

### Google Keep:

Strengths:

- Compact UI that allows for many tasks to be viewed at once.
- Colored tasks as visual aid.
- Checkbox to indicate task completion. Alternatively, tasks can be archived to indicate completion.
- Supports dynamic content such as links, images and drawings.
- Sync through multiple gadget.

Weakness:

- No options for viewing the list of tasks in different orders (most recent, deadline etc)
- No calendar view.

tag <task_id> #<tag_name> [#<tag_name>...]

```
