### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file your created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix A : User Stories

| User Stories | Likely/Not Likely |
| ------ | ----------- |
|As a user I can add an entry by specifying a entry title only, so that I can record entrys that need to be done ‘some day’.|Likely
|As a user I can add entries that have a specific start and end time, so that I can record events with a specific duration.|Likely|
|As a user I can add descriptions to my entries, so that I can add detail to my tasks.|Likely|
|As a user I can edit an entry, so that I can make changes to entries as needed.|Likely|
|As a user I can delete an entry, so that I can get rid of entries that I no longer care to track.|Likely|
|As a user I can list all entries that are due, so that I can get an overview of all my entries.|Likely|
|As a user I can find upcoming entries, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.|Likely|
|As a user, I can set a entry as completed, so that I can keep track of completed/uncompleted entries.|Likely|
|As a user, I can add tags to the entries so that I can categorize entries together|Likely|
|As a user I can search for an entry by different entry attributes, so that I can find specific entries.|Likely|
|As a user I can undo a certain number of actions so that I can correct any mistaken actions.|Likely|
|As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.|Likely|
|As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.|Likely|
|As a user, I can schedule a entry to be automatically added with a given frequency so that I don’t have to manually add entries every time.|Likely|
|As an advanced user, I can specify a specific folder as the data storage location, so that I can choose to store the data file in a local folder controlled by a cloud syncing service, allowing me to access entry data from multiple computers.|Likely|
|As a user, I can choose different views of all my tasks, e.g. “Due Today”, “Due This Week”, so that I can focus on what is important to me at that moment.|Likely|
|As a user, I can use autocompletion of entry description so that I can quickly add entries that are similar to what I have added before|Not Likely|
|As a user, I can personalize my app by changing the color scheme so that it fits my aesthetic requirements.|Not Likely|
|As an advanced user, I can rebind default commands into my own keyboard shortcuts, so that I can use shortcuts that I am comfortable with.|Not Likely|
|As a user, I can type in commands in a more ‘natural’ manner, so that I do not need to learn the command format.|Not Likely|

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `TaskManager` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case: Delete person

**Use case: Create a floating task**

Actors: User

MSS

1. User request to create a new entry without specifying the start and/or end date and deadline
2. TodoList add that particular floating task into Storage and save it

  Use Case Ends

*Extensions*

1a. Entry is entered with invalid properties e.g. title
> 1a1. TodoList warns user that the entry is invalid and does not add it into Storage
>
> Use Case Ends

1b. Entry already exists
> 1b1. TodoList warns user that the entry already exists and does not add it into Storage
>
> Use Case Ends

**Use case: Create an event**

Actors: User

MSS

1. User request to create a new entry while specifying the start and/or end date but not deadline
2. TodoList add that particular event into Storage and save it

  Use Case Ends

**Use Case: Create a deadline**

Actors: User

MSS

1. User request to create a new entry while specifying the deadline but no start and/or end date
2. TodoList add that particular deadline into Storage and save it

  Use Case Ends

**Use Case: Delete an entry**

Actors: User

MSS

1. User requests to delete an entry with a specified id
2. TodoList deletes the entry

  Use Case Ends

*Extensions*

1a. Entry with the specified id does not exist
> 1a1. TodoList warns the user that the entry with the specified id does not exist
>
> Use Case Ends

Our to-do application primarily takes in input using a command line interface. It supports the basic creation, reading, updating and deletion of entries. You may add entries with or without deadlines. These are known as tasks. Entries with a start and/or end time are known as events.

To start, try adding a new task:

```
add Buy groceries
```
<img src="images/add.png" width="600">

You can edit a task with the following command:

```
edit 0 end/tomorrow 5pm
```
Yep, natural language is parsed as well!

<img src="images/edit.png" width="600">

Undo is quite easily done:

```
$ undo

$ list
[ ] Get groceries
```

Finally, try deleting the task:

```
delete 1
```
