### UI component

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/priorityq/ui/Ui.java)

The `view` component is the part of the application that directly interacts with the user. The `view` is created using information supplied from the controller. Thus, a major purpose of view objects is to display data from the application’s model objects and to enable the editing of that data.

To accomplish this, the `view` component communicates all user interactions through the `controller` component to the application’s `model` objects. In turn, any changes in `model` data are propagated through the application’s `controller` objects.

The diagram above gives an overview of the architecture of the `UI` component of PriorityQ. The `UI` consists of a `MainController` which encapsulates the root layout of the GUI. The `MainController` inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class and it can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`. On start-up, the `MainController` initialises an `AppViewController`.

Subsequently, the `AppViewController` initialises the `TaskViewController` and the `HelpViewController`. The former is made up of a `TaskList` which displays `TaskCard`s, while the latter is made up of a `HelpList` which displays `HelpCard`s. Both of them implement the abstract `Controller` class which enforces the implementation of certain methods for initialisation and also provides common and useful controller methods needed by all such view controllers.

To display custom layouts to the user, the `UI` component uses JavaFx `UI` framework. The root layout is a `StackPane` from JavaFX.

`UI` parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the root layout is specified in [`RootLayout.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/RootLayout.fxml), and the `TaskList` is specified in [`TaskList.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/TaskList.fxml).

PriorityQ has its own custom stylesheet which makes the GUI clean and simple. You can find the [css stylesheet](../src/main/resources/view/PriorityQTheme.css) in the same folder as the `.fxml` files.

In summary, the UI component:

- Executes user commands using the Logic component.
- Binds itself to data in the Model so that the UI can auto-update when data in the Model changes.
- Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.
- Raises events for certain user-initiated interactions so that other UI components can respond accordingly.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Crete a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file your created.

### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>

## Appendix A : User Stories

| User Stories | Likely/Not Likely |
| ------ | ----------- |
|As a user I can add an entry by specifying a entry title only, so that I can record entrys that need to be done ‘some day’.|Likely
|As a user I can add entries that have a specific start and end time, so that I can record events with a specific duration.|Likely|
|As a user I can add descriptions to my entries, so that I can add detail to my tasks.|Likely|
|As a user I can edit an entry, so that I can make changes to entries as needed.|Likely|
|As a user I can delete an entry, so that I can get rid of entries that I no longer care to track.|Likely|
|As a user I can list all entries that are due, so that I can get an overview of all my entries.|Likely|
|As a user I can find upcoming entries, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.|Likely|
|As a user, I can set a entry as completed, so that I can keep track of completed/uncompleted entries.|Likely|
|As a user, I can add tags to the entries so that I can categorize entries together|Likely|
|As a user I can search for an entry by different entry attributes, so that I can find specific entries.|Likely|
|As a user I can undo a certain number of actions so that I can correct any mistaken actions.|Likely|
|As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.|Likely|
|As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.|Likely|
|As a user, I can schedule a entry to be automatically added with a given frequency so that I don’t have to manually add entries every time.|Likely|
|As an advanced user, I can specify a specific folder as the data storage location, so that I can choose to store the data file in a local folder controlled by a cloud syncing service, allowing me to access entry data from multiple computers.|Likely|
|As a user, I can choose different views of all my tasks, e.g. “Due Today”, “Due This Week”, so that I can focus on what is important to me at that moment.|Likely|
|As a user, I can use autocompletion of entry description so that I can quickly add entries that are similar to what I have added before|Not Likely|
|As a user, I can personalize my app by changing the color scheme so that it fits my aesthetic requirements.|Not Likely|
|As an advanced user, I can rebind default commands into my own keyboard shortcuts, so that I can use shortcuts that I am comfortable with.|Not Likely|
|As a user, I can type in commands in a more ‘natural’ manner, so that I do not need to learn the command format.|Not Likely|

## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `TaskManager` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case: Delete entry

**Use case: Create a floating task**

Actors: User

MSS

## Introduction
PriorityQ is a task manager for the modern power user who enjoys working primarily without a mouse. You care about productivity and your workflow is largely keyboard-based.

In fact, you could subscribe to the ‘Inbox Zero’ philosophy. Consequently, it is important that you can quickly keep track of tasks that come in. Because of the variety of such tasks and events, you want a manager that is flexible. From creating tasks without a specific deadline to blocking out specific times on your calendar, PriorityQ does it all, in a clean and easy-to-use interface. Use PriorityQ to capture your ideas, goals, wish lists, trip plans and daily tasks.

This user guide aims to provide you with a brief overview of PriorityQ and how to maximize your productivity with it.

## Getting Started

Java 8(Version 1.8) JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is required to run the program. To start, simply download the .jar file from our [release page](https://github.com/CS2103AUG2016-W10-C2/main/releases) and run it by double clicking on the icon.

At the launch of PriorityQ, you should see the following screen:

<img src="images/pq_start.png" width="600"><br>

All tasks and events are sorted in the conventional calendar manner such that your most important tasks and events are displayed at the top. At the bottom of the screen, you will find a command line which enables you to interact with PriorityQ.

## Quick Start

To start, try adding a new task:

```
add Buy groceries
```
<img src="images/add.png" width="600">

The task can be edited with the following command:

```
edit 1 end/tomorrow 5pm
```
Yep, natural language is parsed as well!

Undo is quite easily done:

```
$ undo

$ list
[ ] Get groceries
```

Finally, try deleting the task:

```
delete 1
```
