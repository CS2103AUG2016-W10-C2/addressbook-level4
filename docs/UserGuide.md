## Getting Started

![mockup](images/mockup.png)

Our to-do application primarily takes in input using a command line interface. It supports the basic creation, reading, updating and deletion of entries. You may add entries with or without deadlines. These are known as tasks. Entries with a start and/or end time are known as events.

To start, try adding a new task:

```
$ add Get groceries
```

Before editing a task, you should obtain a task id by listing:

```
$ list

0 [ ] Get groceries
```

You can edit a task with the following command:

```
$ edit 0 end/ 3 October
[ ] Get groceries, deadline: 3 October
```

Undo is quite easily done:

```
$ undo

$ list
[ ] Get groceries
```

Finally, try deleting the task:

```
$ list
[ ] Get groceries

$ delete 0
1 task deleted!

$ list
No tasks to display.
```
